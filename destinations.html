            <h2><u>Switzerland</u></h2>
            <img src="images/switzerland.jpg" alt="switzerland" style="width: 650px; height: auto;">
            <p style="text-align: center;">Switzerland is known as a neutral state. You will often, in situations of
                conflict, hear people say, “I’m Switzerland.” This epithet has been earned given its neutral position in
                regional conflicts and beyond. In line with History, while their army is one of the most advanced ones
                in the world, Switzerland hasn’t been to war since 1505. Its neutrality has also given them the
                advantages they enjoy today, inside and outside Europe. The Federal Council states that they are in the
                Schengen zone and have implemented a few EU laws to accommodate trade, but are not members of the EU.
